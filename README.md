# Food Detection and Calorie Estimation 

Welcome to the Food Detection and Calorie Estimation project! This repository contains a machine learning model and code for detecting various types of food and estimating their calorie content using the MobileNetV2 architecture.


## Introduction
This project utilizes MobileNetV2 and was performed on kaggle notebook, a convolutional neural network architecture optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications, to classify different types of food and estimate their calorie content. The model is trained on a dataset of food images, each labeled with its corresponding food type and calorie information.

## Features
- **Food Detection**: Detects and classifies different types of food from images.
- **Calorie Estimation**: Estimates the calorie content of the detected food items.
- **MobileNetV2**: Uses the efficient and lightweight MobileNetV2 architecture for real-time performance on mobile and embedded devices.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-detection-calorie-estimation.git
    cd food-detection-calorie-estimation
    
2. Create a virtual environment:

3. Install the required packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download the pre-trained model weights (if available) and place them in the `models` directory.

## Usage
To use the food detection and calorie estimation model, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Input Image**: Ensure that the image is in a compatible format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and stored in the `input_images` directory.

2. **Run the Detection Script**: Use the provided script to run the model on the input image:
    python detect_and_estimate.py --image input_images/your_image.jpg

3. **View the Results**: The script will output the detected food types and their estimated calorie content.

## Model Training
If you wish to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it on your own dataset, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Ensure that your dataset is organized with images and corresponding labels for food types and calorie content.

2. **Configure Training Parameters**: Modify the training parameters in `train_config.py` according to your requirements.

3. **Run the Training Script**: Start the training process using the following command:
    python train.py --data_dir path/to/your/dataset

4. **Monitor Training**: Use TensorBoard or similar tools to monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance.
